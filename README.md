# Sid Sancheti - Company Technical Interview Solution

**Due Date:** Friday, Feb 7 @ 7 PM EST

**Important:** When starting localhost, navigate to localhost:3000/cves/lists/ to find the table.

This is my solution to Securin's technical exam assignment.

Prior to running the application, please create a .env file in the server folder. Include the the MongoDB URI under ATLAS_URI, the database name under DB_NAME, and the collection name under COLLECTION_NAME.

Use two separate terminals to run the project:

```{bash}
cd server
npm run dev
```

```{bash}
cd client
npm start
```
