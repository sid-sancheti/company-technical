# Sid Sancheti - Company Technical Interview Solution

**Due Date:** Thur, Feb 6 @ 7 PM EST

**Important:** When starting localhost, navigate to localhost:3000/cves/lists/ to find the table.

This is my solution to Securin's technical exam assignment.

Please note, the .env files in the frontend and backend need to be created in order for the MERN app to work properly.

Use two separate terminals to run the project:

```{bash}
cd server
npm run dev
```

```{bash}
cd client
npm start
```
