# Sid Sancheti - Securin Technical Interview Solution

**Due Date:** Thur, Feb 6 @ 7 PM EST

This is my solution to Securin's technical exam assignment.

Please note, the .env files in the frontend and backend need to be created in order for the MERN app to work properly.

To run the project:

```{bash}
cd server
npm run dev
```

```{bash}
cd ../client
npm start
```
